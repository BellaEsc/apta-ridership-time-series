# apta-ridership-time-series
This repository includes a time series analysis of [ridership data from the American Public Transportation Association (APTA)](https://www.apta.com/research-technical-resources/transit-statistics/ridership-report/) which was compiled by Matthew Dickens (Director of Policy Development and Research). The data includes quarterly reports of unlinked passenger trips from U.S. and Canada transportation agencies, separated by transit mode. In this project, I will be focusing on total ridership across all modes.

I will also be doing an analysis on OCTA's ridership for their Directly Operated (DO) buses.
